Automata
========

Take control of an abandoned factory and produce and automate all kinds of items for the ruler of the land, Lord Dalamar. Be careful though, he is keeping an eye on you. Your actions will effect your reputation and what quests are available. Do as he says and you'll get more rewards. If you turn against him and quests may become even tougher.

Download the pack on the FTB Launcher using the pack code: automata


CoFH ore gen has been configured to only allow coal and Railcraft poor ore to spawn in the overworld and normal ore generation in all other dimensions. Mystcraft ages will be given to the player by the ruler through quest rewards. Ages handed out will get progressively better throughout the quest lines. 
Recipe changes have been made to integrate the mods. Item teleportation recipes will require AE Quantum Entangled Singularities.  There are also many other recipe changes for balance and to fit the theme of "magic is forbidden".
