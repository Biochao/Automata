Automata
========

The basic theme will be automating as many items in the game as possible. Using HQM there will be a story, that the player has been given an abandoned factory by the ruler of this world. Making all kinds of items to raise reputation with the ruler will be a lot of work so automating production will be key. A few Magic mods are included, but items are restricted by the ruler. Having magical items will be detected by HQM and lower the reputation you have with the ruler. New quest lines will open up as this reputation fluctuates. 
CoFH ore gen has been configured to only allow coal and Railcraft poor ore to spawn in the overworld and normal ore generation in all other dimensions. Mystcraft ages will be given to the player by the ruler through quest rewards. Ages handed out will get progressively better throughout the quest lines. 
Recipe changes have been made to integrate the mods. Item teleportation recipes will require AE Quantum Entangled Singularities. Since I am including Buildcraft 6.1 some recipes have been changed to include Redstone Reception Coils to suggest RF compatibility. There is also many other recipe changes for balance and to fit the theme of magic is forbidden.
